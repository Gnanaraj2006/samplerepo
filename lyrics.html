        Georgia, wrap me up in all your-
        I want you in my arms
        Oh, let me hold you
         I'll never let you go again like I did
        Oh, I used to say

        "I would never fall in love again until I found her"
        I said, "I would never fall unless it's you I fall into"
        I was lost within the darkness, but then I found her
        I found you

        Heaven, when I held you again
        How could we ever just be friends?
        I would rather die than let you go
        Juliet to your Romeo, how I heard you say
        "I would never fall in love again until I found her"
        I said, "I would never fall unless it's you I fall into"
        I was lost within the darkness, but then I found her
        I found you

        I would never fall in love again until I found her
        I said, "I would never fall unless it's you I fall into"
        I was lost within the darkness, but then I found her
        I found you
